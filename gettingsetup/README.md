Problems with my website,

- when i click first page i want to go to the gallery view
- when i click second page i want to go to the log in page
- when i click third page i want to go to the sign up page
- when i click fourth page i want to go my favorites but i want the nav bar
- when i click the homepage text on any page i am taken back to the home page
- currently not even the homepage shows up
- for some reason when the homepage loads up it looks awful even though i spent the time
  to style it with bootsrap
- i have a picture in my gallery and it is saved but it doesnt show up for some reason
- when i am redirected i want the url to show what the content of the page im on is, not "firstpage"
- the file names shouldnt be renamed
